==== Prepare your AWS account

Amazon Elasticsearch Service uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Amazon ES. Service-linked roles are predefined by Amazon ES and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. This role can be created by running cloudformation template located under templates/elk-service-linked-role.yaml. or please refer https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/slr-es.html[Service-linked role for Amazon ES^].
