As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*

In the private subnets:
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.

* The Solumina proprietary software.
* Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES).
* A MongoDB resource.
* Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS).

Other Resources:

* An Application Load Balancer to route traffic to the Solumina web application over HTTP.
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).
* An Amazon S3 bucket for storing Quick Start assets.
* Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) to provide on-demand scaling and management of AWS Cloud services and resources.
* A recordset in Route53 for web application.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
